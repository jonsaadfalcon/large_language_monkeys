  \ has N formulae: y = a_i x for i =1, ..., N (inclusive). Now she considers a subsequence\

  \ s_1-th formulae with x = x_0. Next, let x_1 be the output of s_1 and evaluate\
  \ s_2-th formulae with x = x_1, and so on.\n\nShe wants to maximize the final output\
  \ of the procedure, x_{s_k}. If there are many candidates, she wants the \"\"\"\
